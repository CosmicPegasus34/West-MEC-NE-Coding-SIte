                <p>This website is for the NorthEast Coding Program. But, the <a href="contact_us.html">Contact Us</a> Page has information for both Central Campus and NorthEast Campus. The information you can find on the Contact US Page  is our Social Media, Locations, and Attendence Numbers. You have to contact the Attendence Line 24 hours before the next schoo, day if your student won't be attending the program the next day. But, be aware because one day is typically 2 days of work at a high school because the program is 2 1/2 hours.</p>
